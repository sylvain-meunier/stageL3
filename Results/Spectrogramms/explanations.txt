The figures in this folder present different spectrogramms obtained from the quantized approach.

When the file name ends with :
    - amount, then the amount of paths with the same tatum indicates the brightness
    - error, then a brighter point indicates a lower transcription error, except if the background is white. In this case, the convention is the opposite.
