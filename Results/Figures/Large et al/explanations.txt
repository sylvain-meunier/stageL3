We present here some results regarding experiments made on the Large et al. model stability.

The theoretical framework is :
    - First, a metronome with some perturbations (indicated in title for each plot), with various tempo changes
    - Finally, the rhythm ùÑΩ ‚ô©‚ô©is used at the metronome, with no perturbations. In other words, the metronome misses the first beat of each measure in this case. This second experiment starts at 700s.

In terms of legend :
    - Naive refers to the canonical tempo
    - Timekeeper is the Timekeeper model presented in the report
    - Oscillator refers to the Large et al. model where kappa is constant over time
    - Oscillator (kappa-corrected) is the Large et al. model presented in the report
